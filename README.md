# KLayout Plugin: Library for Plugins

* This is intended as a common utility library for our IIC KLayout Plugins:
   * https://github.com/iic-jku/klayout-align-tool
   * https://github.com/iic-jku/klayout-move-tool
   * https://github.com/iic-jku/klayout-pin-tool
   * https://github.com/iic-jku/klayout-layer-shortcuts
   * https://github.com/iic-jku/klayout-auto-backup

This add-on is automatically installed, as it is declared as a `dependency` in the `grain.xml` of plugins re-using it.
